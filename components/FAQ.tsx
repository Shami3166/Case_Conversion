      question: "Is my text safe here?",
      answer:
        "Yes, your text is 100% safe. All conversions happen in your browser — nothing is uploaded, stored, or tracked on our servers.",
      icon: <Shield className="h-5 w-5 text-red-600" />,
    },
    {
      value: "item-5",
      question: "What happens if you don't use a converter?",

    {
      value: "item-6",
      question: "Why does Gen Z love lowercase?",

    {
      value: "item-7",
      question: "Why type in capital letters?",
      answer:
        "Typing in all caps is often used to show emphasis, importance, or emotion — like shouting in text. However, using a case converter helps you balance tone by switching between cases easily.",
      icon: <Wand2 className="h-5 w-5 text-indigo-600" />,
    },
    {
      value: "item-8",

    {
      value: "item-9",
      question: "How fast does it work?",
