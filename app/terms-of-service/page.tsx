              We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. When we
              make changes, we will update the &quot;Last updated&quot; date at
              the top of this page. Changes typically occur when we add new
              features, respond to legal requirements, or improve clarity based
              on user feedback.

              Your continued use of the Service after any changes constitutes
              acceptance of the new terms. We encourage you to review these
              terms periodically. Since we don&apos;t require user accounts, we
              can&apos;t notify you directly about changes, so checking back
              occasionally is your responsibility.

              If we make significant changes that substantially affect your
              rights, we&apos;ll try to provide prominent notice on our website
              for a reasonable period. However, for a free service like ours,
              extensive notification campaigns may not be feasible.

              If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or
              unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the
              minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions will remain
              in full force and effect. This ensures that the rest of the
              agreement remains valid even if one part is found to be
              problematic.
